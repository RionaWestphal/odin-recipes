    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Chicken simmered with celery, onion, mushrooms and soy sauce. This is a quick meal my kids have always called 'popcorn' chicken. Serve with rice, if desired.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cut into 1 inch pieces</li>
        <li>1 cup chopped celery</li>
        <li>2 onions, sliced, separated into rings</li>
        <li>1 (4.5 ounce) can mushrooms, with liquid</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vegetable oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a medium skillet over medium high heat. Saute chicken until all sides are well browned, then stir in the celery, onions, mushrooms with liquid and soy sauce. Cover skillet and bring to a boil; reduce heat to low and simmer for about 15 minutes or until celery is tender and chicken is cooked through.</li>
    </ol>
